        <p> I am Hasna Hena Borna. I am originally from Bangladesh. Currently I am living in Texas. I have completed both of my undergraduate and graduate degrees in Information science and library management from Bangladesh. </p>
        <p> After successful completion of graduate studies, I started my professional career. I had the opportunity to work in both library and academic fields. My first job offered me the chance to collaborate with library professionals from the State University Library, in Bangladesh. In this job, I could contribute in a project that digitized the library resources. Later I also got involved in the library of Australian International School. After that, I switched to academia as a full-time faculty for the Institute of Library and Information Management of National University, a reputed public university of Bangladesh. I also worked as an adjunct faculty of Library Management and Information Science Department at Royal University of Dhaka in Bangladesh. </p>
        <p> After some time, in 2016 I moved to USA.  I realized that I needed to nourish my passion for library and information science here and for that my degrees back home would not be sufficient in this era of specialization. To fulfill my dream, I consider a graduate degree at University of Arizona will be the most appropriate step for me for being an integral part of the library system in this country. </p>
        <p> Since my childhood, I have wished a bright academic career. I have dreamt to be within the best. Sometimes I failed to meet up my expectation but I never regretted for that, because I knew I always gave my full effort for what I desired. This has become my philosophy over the years. “Leave no stone unturned to avail the opportunity” has been my motto. This motto has opted me in pursuit of higher education in the field of Library and Information Science.</p>
        <p> My ultimate goal is to join a library or information institute after the completion of my graduation as I am eager to contribute actively in this field.</p>
